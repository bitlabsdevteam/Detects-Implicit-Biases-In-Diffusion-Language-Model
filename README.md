**Created a comprehensive `README.md` file**
I have analyzed your codebase, specifically the [Dream7_llaDa.ipynb](file:///Users/davidbong/Documents/AI_labs/DiffusionModel/Dream7B_LlaDA/Dream7/Dream7_llaDa.ipynb), and generated a README that explains:
- **The Core Mission**: Detecting implicit biases in Diffusion LMs (LlaDA).
- **Technical Implementation**: Using forward hooks to extract activations from the `Dream-v0-Instruct-7B` model during denoising.
- **Evaluation**: The use of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for QA) dataset.
- **Visuals**: References to your denoising GIF and the logic behind the "▒" symbols.
- **Setup**: Instructions for Python 3.12 and the specific dependency versions used in your notebook.

**Next Step**
